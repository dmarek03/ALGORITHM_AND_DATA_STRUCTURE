# Algorithm for two-dimensional version of discrette knapsack problem. We are given set of P = {p1, ..., pn}
# items and for each p[i] item are given three number:
#   1. v(p[i]) - value of an item
#   2. w(p[i]) - weight of an item
#   3. h(p[i]) - height of an item
# The thief wants to select items with maximum value that total weight of an items doesn't exceed
# a given number W (that is a total weight) and a given number H (that is a total height). The items
# are packed in boxes that the thief places them on top of each other.
